				The verdict passed on the 12th May 1998 by the LG Hamburg rules that the inclusion of links also leads to co-responsibility of the material offered via these links. The LG Hamburg has declared that it is only possible to disclaim responsibility by expressly distancing oneself from the contents of the web sites.
				The cross-platform.org website links to third party information providers. Cross-platform.org has no influence on the contents or reliability of the web sites of these third party information providers. The following therefore applies to all links:

				The declaration is valid for all links given on our website and the material of all sites reached via banners and links on the cross-platform.org website.
